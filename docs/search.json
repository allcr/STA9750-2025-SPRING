    "text": "Proposal 3: Remove overtime pay and increase salaries by the median or average overtime paid\nOvertime expenditure is a significant portion of the overall payroll for New York City. We will review the financial impact of eliminating overtime all together and replacing it with a one time pay raise. This one time raise will be equal to the lower value of the median overtime or the average overtime paid per agency and description.\nThe annualized base pay and the total overtime paid will be used as the base rate instead of the gross rate. This will simplify our analysis, but we lose a degree of accuracy by not including the total other pay for each employee.\nWe will attempt to back-date this analysis by calculating the median overtime paid per agency, job title, and fiscal year. We will then add the median the annualized base pay to create the proposed pay rate. The amount of savings is calculated subtracting the proposed pay rate from the sum of the annualized base pay and the total over paid.\nWe will then compare the results against the annual payroll per year to see the total savings had this methodology been adopted in the past. We will still use 2023 as our high water mark.\n\n\nCode\ntmp &lt;- cleaned |&gt;\n  group_by(fiscal_year, agency_name, title_description) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    average_base_annual_pay = mean(base_annual_pay, ),\n    total_base_annual_pay = sum(base_annual_pay),\n    total_over_time_paid = sum(total_ot_paid),\n    median_over_time_paid = median(total_ot_paid),\n    total_ot_hours = sum(ot_hours),\n    number_employees = n(),\n    proposed_total_salary_increase = number_employees * median_over_time_paid\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    current_pay_total = total_base_annual_pay + total_over_time_paid,\n    proposed_pay_total = total_base_annual_pay + proposed_total_salary_increase,\n    savings = current_pay_total - proposed_pay_total\n  )\n\n\ntotal_savings &lt;- sum(tmp$savings)\n\ntotal_savings_by_agency &lt;- tmp |&gt;\n  group_by(agency_name) |&gt;\n  summarize(agency_savings = sum(savings))\n\n\nWe can see in the below table that the savings are significant each year.\n\n\nCode\ntmp &lt;- tmp |&gt;\n  group_by(fiscal_year) |&gt;\n  summarize(savings = sum(savings, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  rename(\n    \"Total Annual Payroll Savings\" = savings,\n    \"Fiscal Year\" = fiscal_year)\n\n  \ntmp$`Total Annual Payroll Savings` &lt;- format(tmp$`Total Annual Payroll Savings`, big.mark = \",\") \n\nkable(tmp)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# TODO check this\ntotal_savings_by_agency |&gt;\n  slice_max(agency_savings, n = 10) |&gt;\n  rename(\n    \"Agency Name\"=agency_name,\n    \"Agency Savings\"=agency_savings\n  ) |&gt;\n  kable(digits = 0, format.args = list(big.mark = \",\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nAgency Name\nAgency Savings\n\n\n\n\nDept.
